# VS Code C++ Project Script

I made this script for myself so I could quickly make custom project templates for VS Code on Linux.
This script greatly reduces the pain of programming C/C++ with VS Code. See ``src/main.sh`` and ``build.sh`` to see how it all works.

# Features

* Makefile for building.
* VS Code specific ``tasks.json`` and ``launch.json`` to enable building and debugging functions.
* Easy to use folder structure that makes sense for most projects.

# Adaptable

If it doesn't do something you need, CHANGE IT! The scripts are well documented and easy to follow, even if you're new!
